Changelog 5
This patch was pretty small, I simply allowed the user the ability to 'force update' if they weren't 10000000% sure they had the latest version.  I also added a label that tells the version and whether or not it's outdated.

I also REMEMBERED TO UPLOAD THE VISUAL STUDIO FILES AT THE SAME TIME

Sorry for forgetting to do that.

Hope this update makes the program more convenient & user-friendly.  This update is a lot less urgent so this changelog should be an accurate idea of how much writing would usually be in one.


Enjoy!
