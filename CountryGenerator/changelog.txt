Changelog 4
"Whoa, what happened to changelog 3" you ask?  Glad you noticed.  I figure it makes more sense to make the number on the changelog the same number as the version.  This makes a lot of sense.  The reason for this mini-update is to make sure the vestigial updater.vbs is removed on GitHub while allowing a grace period in case something went wrong with the new updater in the process.  As I write this, there is no issue with the updater, and everything should transfer smoothly for newer versions.  My main concern is that, for older versions, the .vbs file may not correctly download the EXE.  I'm hoping that this is only happening to me, but if it is for some reason happening to someone else, please let them know that they need to download the updater executable.  Sorry for any inconvenience.

In lighter news, it just occurred to me that I could make a backup of the latest EXE in case something were to happen in the downloading process, so I think I'll make that real quick and add it to this version.
Done, now a copy is saved to the same directory as 'HOICountryGenerator_Backup.exe'

I hope this new patch allows for a smoother update transition, thanks for reading.
